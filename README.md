# MERNWorkout
This is a demo of a workout application using the MERN stack
In this project, I used MongoDB Atlas as my Database, while using Express and Node for the backend logic
This project involves writing efficient codes and using the MVC architecture to properly organize my files
React concepts that were used are:
useState, useEffect, useContext, fetching from the database using async and await, querying the database from the frontend
The backend applied the use of Express to create the router, mongoose to connect to my database and also create Schema for the data, controller functions to write the CRUD logic and also, Express for the middlewares, dotenv to separate sensitive codes like database connection and port from the application code.
